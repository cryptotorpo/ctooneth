Chief Troll Officer $CTO

They call him the Chief Troll Officer — Elon Musk, the galaxy’s most chaotic meme pilot, steering our rocket-ship coin straight into the moon’s DMs. With every tweet, he bends markets, breaks the internet, and leaves Wall Street crying in Comic Sans. This isn’t just a token, it’s a trolling masterclass on-chain — powered by the man who can send a Doge to Mars with a wink. Buckle up, degenerates, $CTO is in control !
